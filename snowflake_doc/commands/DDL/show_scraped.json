    "usage_notes": "The granted_by column indicates the role that authorized a privilege grant to the grantee. The authorization role is known as the\ngrantor.\nWhen you grant privileges on an object to a role using GRANT <privileges> … TO ROLE, the following authorization rules\ndetermine which role is listed as the grantor of the privilege:\nIf an active role is the object owner (i.e. has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the\nobject), that role is the grantor.\nIf an active role holds the specified permission with the grant option authorized (i.e., the privilege was granted to the active role\nwith the GRANT <privileges> … TO ROLE <role_name> WITH GRANT OPTION, where <role_name> is one of the active roles). If so, the\nrole that holds the privilege with the grant option authorized is the grantor role. Note that if multiple active roles meet this\ncriterion, it is non-deterministic which of the roles becomes the grantor role.\nIf an active role holds the global MANAGE GRANTS privilege, the grantor role is the object owner, not the role that held the\nMANAGE GRANTS privilege. That is, the MANAGE GRANTS privilege allows a role to impersonate the object owner for the purposes of\ngranting privileges on that object.\nIf the granted_by column is empty, the privilege was granted by the Snowflake SYSTEM role. Certain internal operations are\nperformed with this role. Grants of privileges authorized by the SYSTEM role cannot be modified by customers.\nWhen using the SHOW GRANTS … TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE syntax:\nThe grantee_name column specifies the name of the application package.\nThe granted_to column specifies APPLICATION PACKAGE SHARE.\nThe granted_by_role_type column specifies the type of grantor role that performed the grant: ROLE, DATABASE_ROLE, or\nAPPLICATION_ROLE. This column only appears in the output when using the SHOW GRANTS ON syntax.\nA data sharing consumer can only view the privileges on objects that are granted to the share, such as\nSELECT on a table. Depending on how the grants are set up, the output of a SHOW GRANTS command that is run by the consumer might show\nempty values for shared objects in the following columns: granted_to, grantee_name, granted_by_role_type, and\ngranted_by. For example:\nIf an account role owns the shared object, the consumer cannot view the OWNERSHIP privilege on shared objects because the consumer\ncannot access (resolve) the role that owns the object (account roles are not shared).\nIf a database role owns the shared object and the provider shares the database role, the consumer can view the OWNERSHIP privilege on\nthe shared object because they can resolve the shared database role.\nThe grant_options column returns FALSE when you run a SHOW GRANTS ON <object_type> <object_name> command for an object in the\nmanaged access schema.\nThe privilege column includes the OWNERSHIP and MANAGE GRANTS privileges for the role that owns the managed access schema when\nyou run a SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA <managed_access_schema> command.\nWith database roles and the SHOW FUTURE GRANTS TO DATABASE ROLE syntax, the command returns results for database roles that are not\ngranted to a share.\nIn the data sharing consumer account, this command does not return any rows when a shared database role is granted future\nprivileges. However, depending on your account and the timing of support for future privileges to database roles in this command, you\nmight see this error message:\nAs the consumer, ask the provider to revoke the future grants from the shared database role.\nThe command doesn’t require a running warehouse to execute.\nThe command only returns objects for which the current user’s current role has been granted at least one access privilege.\nThe MANAGE GRANTS access privilege implicitly allows its holder to see every object in the account. By default, only the account\nadministrator (users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) and security administrator (users with the SECURITYADMIN role) have the\nMANAGE GRANTS privilege.\nTo post-process the output of this command, you can use the pipe operator\nor the RESULT_SCAN function. Both constructs treat the output as a result set that\nyou can query."
